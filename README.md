# Simple-Calculator
This project is a simple calculator which when run, will answer your basic math problems. It can compute the 4 primary operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication), radical expressions using input for an index and radicand, and calculations in the form of the quadratic formula. I (Schneider Theodule) made this program with the help of Professor Scott Vanselow, Paulo Drefahl, Jakeb Brown, and my TI-84 Plus Calculator. I created this program throughough the fall semester of 2021 using the knowledge I aquired in my Intro to Computer Science course at Florida Gulf Coast University. I made this code for an assignment but I really allowed myself to dive into the processes needed to make something so useful, for us as humans, come to life.

# Built With
          
Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) | Pycharm |
| :--- | :--- |
IDLE can be used to execute a single statement like Python Shell and also create, modify, and execute Python scripts.  | PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. |
IDLE is coded 100% in python using the tkinter graphical user interface (GUI).  | IDE is a software for building applications that combine developer tools into a single GUI. They are designed to make coding easier for programmers. |
